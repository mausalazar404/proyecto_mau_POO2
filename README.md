My project will be a dragon breeder

The Dragon Breeder project is a simulation where the user plays as a dragon trainer. The goal is to raise, care for, and train dragons of different elemental types. Each dragon has unique attributes that can evolve over time. The user interacts with their dragons by feeding them, training them, assigning them to suitable habitats, and eventually letting them participate in battles.


Potential Classes
Dragon: Represents each individual dragon with stats like health, attack, level, happiness, and type

Trainer: Represents the user, who owns and manages multiple dragons.

Habitat: A place where dragons live, limited by capacity 

Food: Consumable items that reduce a dragonâ€™s hunger and improve its stats.

Battle: A system for simulating combat between two dragons based on their attributes.



A Trainer can own several Dragons.

A Dragon can live in a Habitat, depending on compatibility.

Food can be given to Dragons to improve their status.
